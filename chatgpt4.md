Just answer "OK". We are running a 3 round web development competition for young people aged 18-23. We have already passed the first two rounds. I will share with you the description of the tasks for the two rounds so you understand the context.

Just answer "OK". Here is the task for the first round.

Just answer "OK". Here is the task for the second round.

Just answer "OK". As organiser of the competition, I am now creating the tasks for the third and final round. I need your help to make this. The competition will last 2 days and will be divided into 5 modules.

# EuroSkills Herning 2025 Web Development - Hungarian National Competition
## Day 1
### Module A - Speedtest ( 1.5 hour)
### Module B - Dineease Ordering App promo site (3 hours)
## Day 2
### Module C - Dineease Ordering App Backend  (1.5 hours)
### Module D - Dineease Ordering App Admin  (1.5 hours)
### Module E - Dineease Ordering App Admin  (3 hours)

Just answer "OK". Now we will work together on the job description for Module C. In addition to the specification, we will also build a fully working version of the backend for testing in a Node.js/Typescript/Express/MySQL environment.

Just answer "OK". First, we will create a description of the module c and a working backend in Node.js(ts)/Express/Prisma. I have uploaded the first version of the description.

Complete the models with the types of fields. Enter the solution in the form of md code.

Create OpenApi documentation for the endpoints. Provide your solution in a downloadable yaml file.

All endpoints are included in the yaml file

For responses, also add the schema for each endpoint and include all schemas in yaml. E.g      
      responses:
        '200':
          description: An array of orders    
            content:
                application/json:
                schema:
                    type: array
                    items:
                    $ref: '#/components/schemas/Order'

All endpoints are included in the yaml file

Your solution includes: # Additional paths for Orders and Order Items omitted for brevity. Don't omit any schema!

UsThe module description includes the Users model and endpoints, but the yaml file is missing this:
### Users
#### Model
- `id`: INTEGER (Primary Key)
- `firstName`: STRING
- `lastName`: STRING
- `email`: STRING
- `pin`: STRING
- `role`: ENUM('ADMIN', 'WAITER', 'MANAGER')
#### Endpoints
- GET /users
- POST /users
- PUT /users/{id}
- DELETE /users/{id}

How to specify a specific expected answer of response in an open api document. For example, the expected response is 'User cannot be deleted'
        400:
          description: Bad request. User cannot be deleted. Possible reasons - user has open orders, user is the only admin user.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  message:
                    type: string 

Let's make a working beackend as described above. I already have a prepared nodejs/ts project. I have uploaded the most important files of these to show you the initial state. Add the prisma client.

Create a complete schema.prisma based on the previous module-c description and the generated openapi yaml.

Create database connection string in env based on previously uploaded .env content.

Can prisma generate the tables in the database based on schema.prisma?

Here is the connection string in .env: DATABASE_URL="mysql://competitor-1:dineease@localhost:3306/competitor-1" I received this error:  User `competitor-1` was denied access on the database `competitor-1` I checked the credential using mysql cli. It works. What can be the problem?

Create a type.ts file declaring all entity types.

How can I reset db using prisma?

Create an exportable prisma client, in order to be able to use the same client in all places in the project.
